		<h1>Changelog</h1>

        <p class="large"><a class="large" href="https://github.com/cmackay732/Checkbook/releases/download/v1.5.7/Checkbook.Setup-v1.5.7.exe" target="_blank">Version 1.5.7</a> - 8/5/2017</p>

		<h2><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h2>

        <p>Spending Overview...</p>

		<ul>            
            <li class="small">Fixed issue while using Sum Selected where you could total values that were not between January through December.
            <li class="small">Fixed issue where you could change values in the Monthly Income table after editing them in the Category/Payee table. For example, if Payments was selected in Filter Options you could edit the values in the Category/Payee table and the Monthly Income table. Now, if Payments is selected in Filter Options, you can only edit Deposits in the Monthly Income table. If Deposits is selected in Filter Options, you can only edit Payments in the Monthly Income table.
            <li class="small">Fixed issue where you were allowed to load a Scenario with different Filter Options than were currently selected. Checkbook now checks the Filter Options in the Scenario before loading data.
