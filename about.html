		<h1>About Checkbook</h1>
		
		<p class="medium">I created Checkbook for myself and have been developing it in my free time for the past five years. I wanted to make a simple application 
		that did exactly what I wanted. I have developed it to a point where I want to make it available for others to use in hopes that it will be as helpful to others and it is for me.
		<strong>Checkbook is free, so share it and tell everyone you know.</strong> You can check for the latest version with the "Check for Update" menu item in the "Tools" menu.  
		</p>
		
		<p class="medium">Checkbook has also been made public under the <a class="medium" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>. If you want to <a class="medium" href="contribute.html">contribute</a> to Checkbook you can find the code repositories on <a class="medium" href="https://github.com/cmackay732">GitHub</a>.

        <p class="medium">Chris Mackay has been a nerd since 1986. Being born the same year as the release of the first The Legend of Zelda game... it was inevitable.
            Chris currently works full time as a mechanical engineer and programs everything he can get his hands on in his spare time. 
            When he isn&#8217t working or programming you can find him sitting at the piano writing music, playing Zelda, or reading outside in his lazy chair.</p>
